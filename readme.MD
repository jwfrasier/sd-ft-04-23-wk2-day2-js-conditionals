## Conditionals in JS

- In Javascript, you have conditionals in the form of the words

```
if...else

if...else if...else
```

The syntax we use to write conditionals is as follows

```
if (this condition is true){
 ...do some code here
}  else {
 ... do some other code
}
```

```
if (age >= 21){
 // user can drink
}  else {
 // can't drink
}
```

```
if (gpa > 2.9){
 // honor role
}  else if (gpa > 3.4) {
 // you get a cool sash
} else if (gpa === 3.9)  {
    // magna cum laude
} else {
   // you don't get anything
}
```

### Switch Statement

- The syntax for a switch statement is a little different however it's very much like and if else if.

```
switch (key) {
    case value:

        break;

    default:
        break;
}
```

- Here is some code to show you how the switch statement works:

```
const restaurant = "Chipotle";

switch (restaurant) {
  case "Applebees":
    console.log("Man that's too greasy 🍎");
    break;
  case "Ruby Tuesday":
    console.log("Do these even exist anymore?? 🔹");
    break;
  case "Red Lobster":
    console.log("How old are those things in the tanks anyways? 🦞");
    break;
  case "Chilis":
    console.log("Isn't this just more expensive applebees?");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("I guess mcdonalds is gonna be on the menu");
    break;
}

this should print out "Isn't this just more expensive applebees?"
```
